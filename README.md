# Pull DEV Posts to Jekyll Monthly GitHub Action

This repo is based on [dev-posts-to-jekyll-markdown-action](https://github.com/bencgreenberg/dev-posts-to-jekyll-markdown-action) by [bencgreenberg](https://github.com/bencgreenberg).

## Things I changed

- Pull in the entire blog post instead of creating cards.
- Check the latest 15 DEV posts.
- Do not delete any existing posts on my Jekyll site.
